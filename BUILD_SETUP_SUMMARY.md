# Build Setup and Automation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Module Import Error Resolution ✅
- **Issue**: `src/testing/index.ts(9,8): error TS2307: Cannot find module '@dtinsight/molecule-types'`
- **Root Cause**: The `@dtinsight/molecule-types` package was not built, so its type declarations were not available
- **Solution**: 
  - Built the types package first using `pnpm build --filter=@dtinsight/molecule-types`
  - Added missing dependencies (`clsx`, `tailwind-merge`) to the web app
  - Fixed TypeScript configurations in core-legacy and UI packages

### 2. Build Process Configuration ✅
- **Fixed**: `core-legacy` package TypeScript configuration
  - Enabled DTS generation (`dts: true`)
  - Fixed composite project configuration (`composite: false`)
  - Enabled sourcemaps for better debugging
- **Fixed**: `ui` package TypeScript configuration
  - Enabled DTS generation (`dts: true`) 
  - Fixed composite project configuration (`composite: false`)

## Automated Build System

### 1. Pre-PR Check Script ✅
- **Location**: `/workspace/scripts/pre-pr-check.sh`
- **Features**:
  - Installs dependencies if needed
  - Cleans previous builds
  - Builds packages in correct dependency order
  - Runs type checks and linting
  - Verifies all build artifacts are created
  - Provides colored output for better visibility

### 2. Package.json Scripts ✅
Added new scripts to root package.json:
```json
{
  "pre-pr-check": "./scripts/pre-pr-check.sh",
  "build-deps": "pnpm build --filter=@dtinsight/molecule-types && pnpm build --filter=@dtinsight/molecule-shared && pnpm build --filter=@dtinsight/molecule-core-legacy && pnpm build --filter=@dtinsight/molecule-core"
}
```

### 3. GitHub Actions CI Workflow ✅
- **Location**: `/.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Features**:
  - Runs on push to main/develop branches and PRs
  - Tests multiple Node.js versions (18.x, 20.x)
  - Uses pnpm with proper caching
  - Runs type checks, linting, building, and testing
  - Special pre-commit checks for PRs with dependency-ordered builds

## Build Order and Dependencies

The correct build order is:
1. `@dtinsight/molecule-types` (foundation types)
2. `@dtinsight/molecule-shared` (depends on types)
3. `@dtinsight/molecule-core-legacy` (legacy services)
4. `@dtinsight/molecule-core` (new core, depends on types)
5. `@dtinsight/molecule-ui` (depends on core packages)
6. `@dtinsight/molecule-web` (web app, depends on all)

## Usage

### For Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages in correct order
pnpm build-deps

# Run pre-PR checks
pnpm pre-pr-check
```

### For CI/CD
The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- Install dependencies with caching
- Run type checks
- Run linting
- Build all packages
- Run tests (if any)

## Remaining Issues

### UI Package Import Issues
The UI package has import errors where it's trying to import services from `@dtinsight/molecule-core` that are actually in `@dtinsight/molecule-core-legacy`. These need to be resolved by either:
1. Re-exporting the services from the new core package
2. Updating the imports in the UI package to use core-legacy
3. Moving the services to the new core package

### Examples of Missing Exports
- `useLayoutStore`
- `useCommandService`
- `useEditorService`
- `useMenuService`
- `useI18nService`
- `useThemeService`
- `useNotificationService`
- `useSearchService`
- `useTestService`

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Import Issues**: Resolve the service import issues between core and core-legacy packages
2. **Complete Migration**: Continue the migration from core-legacy to the new core package
3. **Add Tests**: Add comprehensive tests to the test suite
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect the new build process

## Success Metrics

✅ **Original TypeScript Error Fixed**: The `@dtinsight/molecule-types` module error is resolved  
✅ **Automated Build Process**: Pre-PR checks and CI workflows are in place  
✅ **Dependency Management**: Proper build order and dependency resolution  
✅ **Developer Experience**: Clear scripts and documentation for contributors  

The build system is now set up to catch issues before PR submission and ensure consistent builds across environments.
