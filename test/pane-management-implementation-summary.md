# Pane Management Implementation Summary

## Task Completed: 10. 实现分栏管理功能

### Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive pane management functionality for the Obsidian-style editor, including dynamic creation/deletion, drag resizing, minimum size limits, and automatic merging logic.

### Features Implemented

#### 1. Dynamic Pane Creation and Deletion
- **Store Methods**: Added `createPane()`, `closePane()`, `mergePanes()` methods
- **UI Integration**: Added close buttons to pane headers in TabBar
- **Smart Deletion**: Automatically moves tabs to adjacent panes before closing
- **Layout Management**: Switches between single/split layouts automatically

#### 2. Pane Size Drag Adjustment
- **Enhanced Splitter**: Improved PaneSplitterComponent with better drag handling
- **Real-time Resize**: Live preview during drag operations
- **Smooth Interactions**: Visual feedback and hover states
- **Keyboard Support**: Arrow key navigation for accessibility

#### 3. Minimum Size Limits
- **Size Validation**: `getPaneMinSize()` returns minimum dimensions (200x150px)
- **Resize Constraints**: Prevents resizing below minimum thresholds
- **Ratio Limits**: Enforces 15%-85% split ratios to maintain usability
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators when limits are reached

#### 4. Automatic Pane Merging Logic
- **Smart Merging**: `autoMergePanes()` detects undersized panes
- **Responsive Behavior**: ResizeObserver monitors container size changes
- **Merge Validation**: `canMergePanes()` checks pane relationships
- **Tab Preservation**: Maintains all tabs during merge operations

### Code Changes

#### Store Enhancements (`obsidian-editor-store.ts`)
```typescript
// New methods added:
mergePanes(paneAId: string, paneBId: string): void
canMergePanes(paneAId: string, paneBId: string): boolean
getPaneMinSize(): { width: number; height: number }
validatePaneSize(paneId: string, width: number, height: number): boolean
autoMergePanes(): void

// Enhanced methods:
closePane() - Now preserves tabs by moving to adjacent panes
resizeSplit() - Added minimum size validation and auto-merge triggers
```

#### Component Updates

**PaneContainer (`pane-container.tsx`)**
- Added responsive ResizeObserver for automatic merging
- Enhanced splitter event handling with double-click reset
- Integrated pane close and merge handlers
- Added minimum size validation throughout

**EditorPane (`editor-pane.tsx`)**
- Added pane close button support
- Enhanced props interface for close functionality
- Integrated with TabBar for pane management

**TabBar (`tab-bar.tsx`)**
- Added pane close button with destructive styling
- Integrated close handler with proper event propagation
- Added conditional rendering based on pane count

**PaneSplitter (`pane-splitter.tsx`)**
- Enhanced with double-click reset functionality
- Improved keyboard navigation support
- Better accessibility attributes and ARIA labels

### User Experience Improvements

#### Visual Enhancements
- **Close Button**: Red-tinted close button in pane headers
- **Hover States**: Clear visual feedback on interactive elements
- **Drag Indicators**: Visual cues during splitter operations
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

#### Interaction Patterns
- **Double-click Reset**: Splitters reset to 50% on double-click
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys for fine splitter adjustment
- **Smart Merging**: Automatic merging when space is constrained
- **Tab Preservation**: Never lose tabs during pane operations

#### Accessibility Features
- **ARIA Labels**: Proper labeling for screen readers
- **Keyboard Support**: Full keyboard navigation capability
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and management
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper roles and attributes

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Minimum Size Logic
```typescript
const minSize = { width: 200, height: 150 };
const minRatio = 0.15; // 15% minimum split ratio
const maxRatio = 0.85; // 85% maximum split ratio
```

#### Auto-merge Triggers
1. **Splitter Resize**: When drag would create pane < minimum size
2. **Container Resize**: When container becomes too small for multiple panes
3. **Manual Trigger**: Via `autoMergePanes()` method call

#### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Width**: Container < 400px (2 × 200px minimum) triggers merge
- **Height**: Container < 300px (2 × 150px minimum) triggers merge

### Testing and Validation

#### Test Coverage
- ✅ Pane creation and deletion
- ✅ Splitter drag and resize
- ✅ Minimum size validation
- ✅ Auto-merge logic
- ✅ Tab preservation
- ✅ Keyboard navigation
- ✅ Accessibility features

#### Demo Scripts
- `test/pane-management-demo.js` - Comprehensive functionality demo
- `test/pane-management-verification.js` - Validation script
- `packages/ui/src/components/obsidian-editor/__tests__/pane-management.test.tsx` - Unit tests

### Requirements Mapping

| Requirement | Implementation | Status |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| 3.4 - 支持分栏的动态创建和删除 | `createPane()`, `closePane()` methods + UI controls | ✅ Complete |
| 3.5 - 实现分栏大小的拖拽调整 | Enhanced PaneSplitter with drag handling | ✅ Complete |
| 7.5 - 处理分栏的最小尺寸限制 | `getPaneMinSize()`, validation logic | ✅ Complete |
| Auto-merge logic | `autoMergePanes()`, responsive behavior | ✅ Complete |

### Performance Considerations

#### Optimizations
- **Debounced Resize**: ResizeObserver with efficient handling
- **Memoized Calculations**: Cached minimum size calculations
- **Event Delegation**: Efficient event handling for drag operations
- **Selective Re-renders**: Optimized React rendering patterns

#### Memory Management
- **Cleanup Handlers**: Proper event listener cleanup
- **Observer Disposal**: ResizeObserver disconnection on unmount
- **State Normalization**: Efficient state structure for large pane counts

### Future Enhancements

#### Potential Improvements
1. **Persistent Layout**: Save/restore pane configurations
2. **Custom Minimums**: Per-pane minimum size settings
3. **Snap Zones**: Magnetic snap points during resize
4. **Animation**: Smooth transitions for merge/split operations
5. **Touch Support**: Mobile-friendly drag interactions

#### Extension Points
- **Plugin API**: Hooks for custom pane behaviors
- **Theme Integration**: Customizable splitter appearance
- **Gesture Support**: Multi-touch and gesture recognition
- **Performance Monitoring**: Metrics for large layouts

## Conclusion

The pane management functionality has been successfully implemented with comprehensive support for:
- ✅ Dynamic pane creation and deletion
- ✅ Drag-based size adjustment with constraints
- ✅ Minimum size enforcement and validation
- ✅ Intelligent automatic merging logic
- ✅ Responsive behavior and accessibility
- ✅ Comprehensive testing and validation

All requirements from task 10 have been fulfilled, providing users with a robust and intuitive pane management system that maintains usability across different screen sizes and interaction patterns.
