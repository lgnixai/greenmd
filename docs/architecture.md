### Molecule Obsidian-like Project â€” Target Architecture

This document proposes a modular, extensible architecture optimized for maintainability and growth. It separates concerns across core domain logic, UI, editor adapters, and extension APIs, and formalizes boundaries and extension points.

## Monorepo Layout

## Package Boundaries

- core
  - Owns domain types, services, and pure utilities
  - No React components; Zustand is acceptable but React-free
  - Exposes typed service hooks/selectors and extension contracts
  - Example: `panelTree` logic, command service, menu service, extension service, search service, i18n service, theme service

- editor
  - Owns editor implementation details (Monaco, diff, language services)
  - Exposes adapter interfaces for `core` services to call

- ui
  - Owns React components and feature views
  - Depends on `core` for state/services and `editor` for editor components
  - Contains only UI-specific state (e.g., transient view preferences)

- extensions
  - Owns extension modules consuming `core` contracts
  - No direct dependency on `ui` components unless explicitly allowed via view contributions

## Extension Points (Contributes)

- Commands, Menus, Keybindings
- Views (tree/webview/terminal), StatusBar, ActivityBar items
- Themes, Locales, Settings schema
- Editor contributions (language features, decorations)

## State Management

- Use Zustand slices per feature with explicit actions
- Co-locate slice logic in `packages/core/src/services/<feature>/...`
- UI consumes slices via typed hooks exposed by `core`
- Avoid business logic in UI; keep UI declarative

## Panel Tree Ownership

- Source of truth in `core` under `utils/panelTree.ts`
- Services operate on panel tree immutably; UI calls service actions
- UI should avoid duplicating panel traversal/manipulation logic

## Coding Conventions

- Strong types for public APIs; no `any` in exported signatures
- Feature-first directory structure in UI (`features/<feature>`)
- Avoid deep nesting; prefer early returns and small functions
- Keep React components presentational; move side-effects to hooks/services

## Build & Distribution

- Each package builds to ESM+CJS via tsup
- `core` exports only type-safe public surface; internal folders remain private
- `ui` re-exports only stable components and feature entry points

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests in each package close to source
- Integration tests in `apps/web` composing multiple packages
- Contract tests for extension API stability
